**Instructions for Running the WiFi Password Retrieval Script**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Save the Code:**
   - Save the provided Python code into a file with a `.py` extension. For example, you can name it `wifi_password_retrieval.py`.

3. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal:**
   - Open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on macOS or Linux).

4. **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.
   - For example: `cd path/to/script_directory`

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the Python script by entering the following command:
     ```
     python wifi_password_retrieval.py
     ```
     Replace `wifi_password_retrieval.py` with the actual name of your script if it's different.

6. **View WiFi Profiles and Passwords:**
   - The script will execute and display a list of WiFi profiles along with their passwords (if available).
   - WiFi profiles without passwords will be omitted from the list.

7. **Note:**
   - The script uses the `netsh` utility to retrieve WiFi profiles and passwords.
   - Some WiFi profiles may not have passwords, and they will be marked as "None."

8. **Exit the Script:**
   - After the script has completed, you can close the command prompt or terminal.

**Security Note:**
- This script retrieves WiFi passwords stored on your computer. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access this information.
